Features: 

* Balbum works hand in hand with Chrome bookmarks. Your current bookmarks are considered by the app, and new bookmarks added from the extension will be considered by Chrome.
* Balbum stores data using localstorage.

# How to use it locally in your computer

1. In your pc, clone the github repository: ```git clone https://github.com/sebazc/Balbum.git```

1. In your browser, got to **chrome://extensions/**.

1. Then turn on **Developer mode**.

1. Click on **Load unpacked**.

1. Select the folder where the code was downloaded after the first step.
